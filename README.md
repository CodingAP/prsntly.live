## How to use

For the prototype backend, run `cd presentation/` then run `node .` to start the server
You can then go to `localhost:1337` to upload presentations and run prototype

## Road Map

October 2-9:
- Setup project and get default app generated
- Create design document and define MVP
- Create UI mockup and define base UI tropes

October 10-16:
- Create a prototype to base apps on
- Continue working on UI mockups (turn paper into Figma board)

October 17-23:
- Finish prototype
- Create Figma board for both web and app
- Finish design document for MVP
